Final Fantasy Review Site

Disclaimer: 
  This is not an official Final Fantasy website. The intention of this website is to create a fan website that talks about, review, and rank each Final Fantasy game. None of the Intellectual Property and copyright is owned by me. This is just a fan website.

Description: 
  This is a Final Fantasy website that reviews and ranks each Final Fantasy game. It'll give brief a description of the story of each game, development history, and what I thought of the game. There will be images of gameplay throughout the website. 
  
  On the home page, there will be a large Final Fantasy logo which will animate down, when the user scrolls down. There will be an about paragraph talking about what this website is. There will also be a disclaimer paragraph talking about this not being an official site. On the main body of the website, there will be boxes, with 3 fixed number of columns, but an incremental amount of rows. Each box will have the title of each game and a transparent image of the main characters. There will be animation when the user hovers the mouse over each box using JavaScript. 
  
  On most of the pages when the user clicks on a box, there be a large picture of the game's cover on the top. Scrolling down, there will be body of the page, which consists of: Story/Synopsis, Development history (If there is one), What I thought of the game, and Conclusion. There will also be images that relates to the game. 
  
  There will also be a page on how I rank each game. It'll give an overall conclusion/final thoughts on the game and rank them respectively. 
  
  In the future, there are plans to allow the user to input what they think of the games as well. Users will be able to input their own thoughts on the game on a separate page and can put it in either a separate page or on the main page.
