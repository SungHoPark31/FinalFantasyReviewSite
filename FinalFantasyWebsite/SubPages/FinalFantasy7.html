        <h1>Final Fantasy VII</h1>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VII. The most important one. The most iconic one. The most memorable one. The most popular one. My first Final Fantasy and my favorite one. 
            Final Fantasy VII impacted so many players and it means a lot to those who played it. Its story, the characters, the setting, the environment, the graphics, the character art, the gameplay, the music, all of them are phenomenally presented here.
            There is a reason that this game is a cultural icon. Even people who have never played the game recognizes Cloud Strife, the Buster Sword, and/or the great villain Sephiroth. 
            Final Fantasy VII is referenced everywhere, and even some elements are in other games. Games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Kingdom Hearts, a lot of spinoffs for other Final Fantasys and other games. 
            After the success of Final Fantasy VI, when VII came out, there have been debates on which of these two is considered the best in the series. With this review, this will be the one that I will talk about the most. Without further adue, here is Final Fantasy VII. 
        </p2>

        <h2>The Characters</h2>
        <p2>
            What I love about each of the characters is that they are all memorable, interesting, distinct and different from one another, and well written.
        </p2>
        <h4>Cloud Strife</h4>
        <p2>
            Cloud Strife is a mercenary that is an ex-SOLDIER. SOLDIERs are an elite military group for Shinra. They have superhuman abilities, like super strength, super speed, durability, agility, endurance, the ability to jump really high, and the ability to squat a lot. 
            He carries the infamous Buster Sword that is just as tall and just as wide as him. This makes him the main Swordman of the group. He is the hero of the story that is overly-cocky at times, a bit of an asshole, and kind of a dork. 
            He tries overly-hard to be the cool one of the group, always seeming uninterested, and suffers from being unreliable at times. It may seem like he is unfit to be the main character that you play, but underneath all of that, he is a good, caring person at heart that deeply cares for all of his friends. 
            He has the most complex and the most interesting arc in the game. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Tifa Lockhart</h4>
        <p2>
            Tifa Lockhart is Cloud's childhood friend. She is trained in martial arts and owns a bar/restaurant, 7th Heaven. She is the monk of the group, meaning she uses her excellent skills in hand-to-hand combat. 
            She is timid and shy, keeping her thoughts to herself thinking that its better to not overshare or not to hurt other's feelings. This makes her a bit more observant in the group. She is kind, empathetic, and caring to the group (especially Cloud). 
            She is the type of person that will have your back as she has shown multiple times throughout the game that she will fight for her friends. Although her character arc is not so clear on the surface level, if you look deeper into her arc, she also has the most complex and interesting arc along with Cloud. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Barret Wallace</h4>
        <p2>
            Barret Wallace is one of the first person that you meet in the game. He is large and has a machine gun for a right hand. Barret is the gunman/ranged character. He is loud, energetic, stubborn, short-tempered, passionate for destroying Shinra, and reckless by going in headfirst at times. 
            He is very caring towards his teammates, but his main motivation for everything he does is through the protection of his surrogate daughter, Marlene. He's just a father that wants Marlene to live in a peaceful world. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Aerith Gainsborough</h4>
        <p2>
            Aerith Gainsborough is the flower girl that we see in the beginning of the game. It is revealed that she is the last remaining Cetra, beings that originated Gaia that can communicate with the planet. She has a very fun personality; 
            She is very positive, kind to literally everyone, courageous, quirky, and flirtatious to Cloud. Her intentions are never bad, almost angel-like. She is super supportative to the group and very intune with nature. This makes her the healer of the group. However, she is reckless and stubborn at times, which can lead her to trouble. 
            A character that feels almost too good to be in the environment of the game. 
        </p2>
        <h4>The Other Side Characters</h4>
        <p2>
            To wrap up on some characters quickly, Red XIII is a talking lion-wolf like beast that is another playable character. He is intelligent, polite to his teammates, and unintentionally funny with some of his dialogue. Cid Highwind, the Dragoon of the group, a harsh asshole, and a person who dreams of flying to space. 
            Vincent Valentine, an even more emo character than Cloud with his dark and brooding demenor, despises Professor Hojo for the birth of Sephiroth and all his immoral experiments. Yuffie Kisaragi, the thief, who is young, aggressive and a bit rebellious, just wants her city of Wutai to return to its former glory. 
            And then there's Cait Sith, who is definitely the worst character of the entire game. He doesn't really help the group much, other than letting them escape some situations, but he's annoying and a Shinra spy, who won't die. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            One thing I like about the story is that even though it mainly focuses on Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and Aerith, the side characters were also fleshed out as well. Although some of the side characters doesn't have as much depth (in my opinion) as the main four, the story has sections in the game where characters would get arcs, fleshing them out. 
            Except for Cait Sith. I don't like him. 
        </p2>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Story: SPOILERS</h2>
        <p2>
            This game definitely hooks the player in as it starts with Aerith. We see the game ditches the 2D sprite based graphics and went for more 3D models and cinematics. It was revolutionary for 1997. If we look back at it now, it will look outdated, but I personally appreciate its charm. 
            Aerith walks out into a large area and the camera pulls back revealing that huge eye-popping model of Midgar. The music crescendos and at its peak, the title comes in almost welcoming the player to the world. As the music slows down and decrescendos, the camera flies to an area where a train pulls up, introducing our characters. 
            We meet Cloud Strife, and Barret Wallace. Their mission is to destroy the Mako Reactor, a reactor that sucks up the life force of the Earth and powers up the entire city. They succeed and head back to Sector 7 at the lower plate. 
            Cloud meets a lot of friends along the way, and together they have to fight against the Electrical Company, Shinra, who is killing the Earth and stop the all-powerful Sephiroth from destroying the world. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Sephiroth and JENOVA</h4>
        <p2>
            Once thought of as a hero to all, now thought of as a ruthless, dangerous entity. Upon learning about the truth about JENOVA, about what he believes to be his origin, Sephiroth goes on a murderous rampage in the village of Nibelheim. He claims himself to be a god and off to reclaim his mother JENOVA. 
            JENOVA is an extra-terrestrial lifeform that fell from the sky and destroyed most of the Cetra/Ancients two thousand years ago. JENOVA was rediscovered many years later by Shinra. Infusing JENOVA's cells and Mako energy to create the ultimate weapon for them called SOLDIER. Sephiroth was the first experiment and was proven successful. 
            Sephiroth learns of this, however, he has learned wrong information. He believes that JENOVA was a Cetra and that the humans betrayed her and killed her, making him the last Cetra. Which is why he goes on a murderous rampage. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            Sephiroth was defeated by Cloud and haven't been heard of since. Until the beginning events of Final Fantasy. It is revealed that Sephiroth is alive and is coming up with a plan. After the Nibelheim incident, Professor Hojo of Shinra gave every survivor of Nibelheim JENOVA cells and Mako energy, similar to SOLDIER's procedure. 
            Sephiroth gained control of JENOVA and she has control those with the JENOVA cells injected into them, including SOLDIER. Her cells are like magnets, and will always return to the original body. Hence called the Reunion. Sephiroth wants JENOVA to be whole again and use Black Materia to summon meteor to injure the Earth, forcing it to heal itself with the Lifestream. 
            Sephiroth plans to fuse with the lifestream to become god and destroy the world for betraying JENOVA all those years ago. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            I am not gonna lie, some of the details of Sephiroth's plan is kind of confusing. There is so much going on that it can be lost in translation or it can be hard to follow at times. Some information given to us as a player aren't very clear. Like the purpose of JENOVA and the Reunion of the Sephiroth Clones. 
            Apparently, the people who are injected with JENOVA/Mako energy are labeled as Sephiroth clones, meaning both Cloud and Zack are labeled as such. I thought it was confusing because shouldn't they be labeled JENOVA clones? 
            I guess because Sephiroth is controlling JENOVA and she is controlling those people, that makes them Sephiroth clones? The plan was very believable but some details are confusing. 
        </p2>
        <h4>The Big Twist 1</h4>
        <p2>
            Around the end of Disc 1, the party heads to the City of the Ancients. Aerith plans to go there alone to save the planet by casting holy. The party meets her there but is interrupted by JENOVA who has Sephiroth's form who impales her with his sword. 
            Aerith dies and there's no bringing her back. Aerith's death goes on to be the most spoiled and the most infamous character deaths in video game history because of the fact that there's no way to bring her back. Many players have tried, but with no success. 
            Death is quick. It is sudden, and we feel that in the game. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            Before playing the game, I was spoiled on it so I knew it was going to happen. Once I got context on everything, I thought it was pretty dumb for Aerith to go alone. She should have at least had people accompany her to help perform the task. 
            At the moment of her death, I didn't really feel that emotional. But what did make me feel emotional was that her theme plays as you are fighting one of JENOVA's form. She was the flower girl, destined to save the world with holy, a kind, compassionate being, gone in an instant.
        </p2>
        <h4>The Big Twist 2</h4>
        <p2>
            Cloud goes through a lot as his story is about self-discovery, and broken identity. When you meet Cloud for the first time, he is introduced as ex-SOLDIER, implying that he made it into SOLDIER at one point. Cloud recalls to a memory where he makes a promise to Tifa that he'll join SOLDIER to save her one day. 
            Throughout the game, Tifa and the rest of the party questions if Cloud is telling the truth with his storys. Around Disc 1 and beginning of Disc 2, Cloud goes through an existential crisis because it is illuded that he is a Sephiroth clone. Sephiroth calls to Cloud in his mind and Cloud does what he wishes, as if he is mind-controlled. 
            Cloud gets mako poisoning and falls into the lifestream with Tifa. With Tifa's help, he uncovers who he is and what happened to him. The stories that he told to his party was not true. He never made it to SOLDIER. He was just a Shinra grunt. He was friends with a SOLDIER thouugh, with the name Zack Fair. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            They both were exposed to mako poisoning, but Zack, being a SOLDIER who is already used to JENOVA cells and Mako, recovers from it much faster. The two escape the experiments, and head for Midgar. Zack sacrifices his life to save a mako poisoned Cloud. In his final words, Zack gives Cloud the Buster Sword. 
            Through a lot of traumatic experiences, Cloud took the identity of Zack, and he believed it, meaning he has been living a lie. In the lifestream, with the help of Tifa, Cloud was able to uncover this truth. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            I think this makes Cloud one of the most complex character in the series. In the big picture, Cloud has failed. He recognizes his failures and cannot see Tifa eye-to-eye because of the promise. Throughout the game, he wants to save people but do it in a "cool guy" fashion but ends up getting saved a lot. 
            Characters in story go through arcs that help them achieve a great goal. Luke Skywalker's desire to be a Jedi, Frodo's goal is to destroy the Ring of Power at Mordor, Harry Potter finally destroying the evil dark lord. Cloud never achieved his goal to becoming a SOLDIER. 
            Instead, he had to lie about it and he believed it. Once it was revealed to him that he was lying, he accepts his true self and moves forward with his journey. 
        </p2>
        <h4>My Thoughts Overall</h4>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy game and I love the story. There are so many interesting and a very diverse set of characters. The story is super impactful and the plot is super interesting to follow, and the lore is very rich. The story deals with the themes of self-discovery, life and death, the value of life, trauma, and anxiety.
            I can't really find anything bad about the story except for two things. Sometimes, the pacing and the tone can be a little weird. After the emotional death of Aerith, the characters mourn her. Cloud sends her off to the bottom of the lake, everything is super sad. 
            Then ten minutes later, Cloud goes snowboarding. This is one of the few instances where the tone was a little weird. Overall, I think the story is phenomenal and honestly, peak storytelling. 
        </p2>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VII not only gave us peak storytelling and interesting characters, the gameplay also made some major changes and improvements. For one, the game incorporates the "role-playing" aspect a lot. 
            One of which is the branching dialogue. When characters ask you questions or interact with you, there are portions in the game where you can choose how Cloud (or you as the player) responds to these characters. Depending on what you respond with, it affects the story but only a little, which I thought was cool. 
            The most notable one is characters will ask certain things and depending on your answer, it goes into a point system. This point system determines who you go on a date with at the Golden Saucer. Aerith is the most easiest to get, Tifa is moderately medium, Barret and Yuffie are one of the more harder ones to get. 
            It really makes you feel like you as a player are in the game roleplaying as Cloud, which helps with the immersion.
        </p2>
        <h4>The Materia System</h4>
        <p2>
            The huge change to this game, and among the most iconic one, is the materia system. Throughout the game, you will get orbs of Mako called Materia. Each Materia is a different ability. It can be magic materia like fire, blizzard, thunder, or cure; or it can be just useful abilities such as 4x cut, or the elemental materia.
            Once you upgrade the materia to mastery level, that materia can be interchanged with another person without affecting its mastery level. Which means you don't have to grind this materia when it is equiped with another person. It is super convenient and saves a lot of time. 
            You can interchange materia anytime you want but there are always a limited amount of Materia slots depending on the weapon or armor you have. It is super customizable and very exploitable, meaning if you pair certain Materia together, it can make you feel extremely powerful, god-like even. 
            I love the gameplay because of the Materia system. It was done super well, very fun, and it made me want to explore the world to find what other Materia that I can find. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Limit Breaks</h4>
        <p4>
            The game introduced Limit Breaks. Characters will gain meter everytime they get hit. Once the meter reaches full, characters can perform Limit Breaks. They are extremely powerful super attacks that has many uses. Cloud, who has multiple depending on his level, unleashes powerful sword attacks. 
            Tifa unleashes a flurry of punches, kicks, and suplexes opponents using a slot mechanic. Barret, depending on his level, can shoot strong projectiles. Aerith can either buff or heal the party. Cid does the signature jump, or other various attacks. Red XIII attacks and/or buffs the party. 
            Yuffie can attack various quantity of enemies in the battlefield. Then there's Vincent. He turns into a beast and you cannot control him. And there is Cait Sith. He has a chance of killing the entire party. 
            Limit Breaks are a very great addition to the gameplay. It is very clutch in many situations as it acts like a comeback mechanic as well. 
        </p4>
        <hr>
        <h2>My Thoughts on Graphics</h2>
        <p2>
            For 1997, I think the graphics looked really good. Maybe not when you're looking at them now but there are mods to help the game graphically which helps a lot. The game introduced cinematic cutscenes into the series. Even looking back at these cutscenes, they still look very good. 
            In Final Fantasy's marketing, they only showed the cutscenes which made people interested in the game. In the actual game, characters are resembling Lego Minifigures. I'm not gonna lie, it doesn't look too good, but I feel like they have a certain charm to them. Tetsuya Nomura's character design for this game was also very good. 
            I wished that the in-game characters were the Nomura's original drawing. That is possible with mods though which is great. I love the background art of the game. It looks like it is a painting, with characters and items being the only ones that are Computer Generated. 
            The background art is painted beautifully and captures the world of Final Fantasy VII really well. Another reason why I love Final Fantasy VII is the asthetic and the atmosphere of the world.
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            The level design is okay, but this is the first game where they incorporated camera angles in Final Fantasy. There are times where the camera angles are very cool and captures the emotion and the story. However, there are times where the camera angles are inconvenient. 
            There are some areas where the camera is so wonky that it can be disorienting. Depending on an area, you have to recalibrate the movement to the area. It can be very annoying because there will be times where I enter a room just to accidentally exit it. 
        </p2>
        <hr>
        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2>
        <p2>
            In my opinion, I think Final Fantasy VII has the best music in the series because of it being the most iconic, most memorable, and the most emotional. The entire track is so recognizable. When I play a tune from the soundtrack, I recognize when and where it was played, even if some tracks repeat in different areas. 
            The battle theme and the boss theme are always very recognizable and makes me feel pumped to battle. The iconic Aerith theme acts as a motif for her and even in her death. The calming motif of Tifa's theme when she's around. The loud and headstrong track of Barret's theme. 
            The iconic tracks of Cosmo Canyon, the storytelling of Anxiety. The music tells and moves the story forward. There are no tracks that I do not like as well as many underrated tracks like Open Your Heart and Words Drowned By Fireworks. Final Fantasy VII's music is what I consider to be a perfect soundtrack.
        </p2>
        <h4>One Winged Angel</h4>
        <p2>
            This track is a section in it of itself. This is the most recognizable and arguably the best track in the entire Final Fantasy series. This track occurs at the final battle against Safer Sephiroth and it is amazing. In my opinion, this is the definition of boss music. 
            It sounds so menacing and powerful with Sephiroth's presence. The history of this track is also very interesting. Nobou Uematsu didn't know how to make the music fully but had many ideas for it. 
            So he made the song a couple of measures at a time, and mixed and matched the track like a puzzle. He did a lot of mixing mand matching until he arrived with the final product of One Winged Angel. 
            I believe that this theory is applied with the Remake, because the One Winged Angel in the Remake has the same measures and sounds in different places while adding new things in. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            My first exposure was with Final Fantasy was actually Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children when I was around eight or nine. I never played the original game, but One Winged Angel in Advent Children stuck with me all throughout my childhood until I played the original Final Fantasy VII as an adult. 
            It was One Winged Angel and the Battle themes that made me love the music without even playing the game. 
        </p2>
        <hr>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VII is by far, the most important entry the Final Fantasy in the series. It was a system seller for the PlayStation 1, it put Final Fantasy on the map for Western gamers, and it normalized RPGs. Before, it was a lot of platformers like Mario, Metroid, and Megaman. 
            Final Fantasy VII influenced the gaming industry a significant amount moving forward. It was very ahead of its time in terms of storytelling, characters, gameplay, graphics, and music. It was my first Final Fantasy and my favorite game of all time. 
            It is truly a masterpiece and to say that I would recommend it is a no-brainer. It is definitely a classic and a game that should be played at least once by everyone. With the legacy it implanted in the gaming industry, Final Fantasy VII will always be remembered as a very important game till the end of time.
