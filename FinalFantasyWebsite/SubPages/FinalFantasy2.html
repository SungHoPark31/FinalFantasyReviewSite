        <h1>Final Fantasy II</h1>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            Similar to the first Final Fantasy, there isn't a lot to cover in terms of story. If there was a central theme of the "story", I'd say rebellion.
            There were efforts to give characters more to say and more to do, but ends up being the same as the first. A series of fetch quests, and becoming stronger to fight the ultimate evil.
            The changes that were made is the learning system. Certain NPC characters will give you exposition and when the words are highlighted red, then you can learn that key word.
            Once you learn this key word, you can progress through the story by telling certain NPCs the right key word at the right place. 
            In my opinion, I didn't like this mechanic of key words. It almost seems like this was the predecesdor to multiple dialogue options in future RPGs. 
            However, this mechanic doesn't end up being too fun to do, and it feels more like a chore instead of progressing through the story.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <h4>Progression</h4>
        <p2>
            Although it is a sequel, it feels mostly the same as the first game. But worse. For starters, the progression system. In FFII, your character doesn't level up after gaining experience points.
            Your weapons do. And there are around nine to ten different kinds of weapons in total. This encourages players to grind other weapons to make your arsenal more stronger.
            However, the problem with this is that you have to do this for each individual character. Weapon level-ups don't transfer from one character to another.
            This can be frustrating at times as it can lead to the game being very grindy and a tedious waste of time. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Random Battles</h4>
        <p2>
            It is very common for a JRPG to contain random battle. That is how the player levels up and gets stronger to progress through the game. Normally, as the name implies, these fights with monsters are random.
            Not in Final Fantasy II. This game has to have one of the most atrocious random battle system of the series. Instead of random, it is every five to ten steps into the map. 
            There would be times when you are trying to go from one room to the next and an encounter triggers when you reach the door. It will get annoying, tedious, frustrating, and time wasting. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Level Design</h4>
        <p2>
            Level design in games is what makes the game fun. If it does its job well, then the player will enjoy the experience. However, in this game, it was the first time I noticed its bad level design. 
            In my opinion, the level design in Final Fantasy II is what makes the game excruciatingly painful to play. There would be a map layout of a large room with many mini rooms. 
            If the player is a completist, they'll want to go into every mini-room. Usually a mini-room will have something valuable, like a new weapon, or an important item. 
            Well, I wouldn't bother because 40% of the mini-rooms have a chest in them and the other 60% is empty. Also, chests in the map are located on the opposite side of each other, meaning that you'll spend a lot of time walking.
            And on top of that you'll have random encounters every five to ten steps. So at the end of the day, you'll be wasting your time

        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2> 
        <p2>
            Nobou Uematsu's composure for Final Fantasy II was really good. There are a lot of memorable tracks such as "The Rebel Army", "The Town", or "The Imperial Army". 
            However, I also think that this game's soundtrack wasn't as memorable compared to some of his other works. Similar to the first game, it does play the crystal prelude in the title screen and the Final Fantasy theme plays really well here. 
            Although there are a couple of outstanding tracks, the music seemed pretty average.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy II is one of the first game in the series where I thought wasn't that great. I do appreciate this game for trying to do something new. 
            Such as implementing a key word system, a different kind of progression system, and trying to put a story together. Great concepts, but failed in execution. Would I recommend it? 
            No I wouldn't. I'd only play this game if you really want to complete your Final Fantasy playthrough. Otherwise, I would advise against playing it. It doesn't feel good to play and it isn't fun.
