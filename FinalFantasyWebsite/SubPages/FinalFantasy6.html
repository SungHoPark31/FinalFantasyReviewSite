        <h1>Final Fantasy VI</h1>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VI is widely regarded as the best Final Fantasy and JRPG to many fans of the series. In many top 5 or top 10 lists for best Final Fantasys, this one usually pops up at the top. 
            This is due to the incredible storytelling with high stakes, interesting characters and settings, amazing music, great visuals, and very fun gameplay. For me, it took a long while to get into the game. 
            I think it took me until halfway through the game to finally get hooked to it. But once I was hooked, it couldn't put it down.

        <h2>The Story: SPOILERS</h2>
        <p2>
            Already, from the very beginning of the game, this is the darkest and the most serious Final Fantasy game. Magic is all but a legend. The Empire has seized a powerful entity called the Espers, who have the ability to use magic, and use them to power up their technology called the Magitek. 
            The story begins with the Empire taking over various lands. You play as a woman named Terra. A mystery girl who is set on a mission to go to Narshe and take an Esper encased in ice. The Esper awakens from the ice causing Terra to be knocked unconscious. 
            She awakes at a house, and the one taking care of her was a man named Arvis. He informs her that she has been mind-controlled by the Empire, engaging in horrible tasks for them. 
            The Narshe guards come after Terra to arrest her. Terra is given a flashback of all the horrible things she has done and the person who commanded her, Kefka, the main villain of the story who wants nothing but power. 
            Locke, a thief, accompanies her on her escape, and is tasked to escort her to the Returners, the rebellion of the Empire. 
            The two of them, along with many friends that the meet along the way, set on a mission to fight against the Empire and put an end to their evils. 
        </p2>
        <h4>The Characters</h4>
        <p2>
            There are a grand total of 14 playable characters. You have Terra, a woman suffering from amnesia set to fight against the Empire. Locke, a thief who is haunted by his past, is one of the members of the Rebellion. 
            Sabin, a Monk, and Edgar, a King, two twins on different paths with the same goal of defeating the Empire. Celes, an ex-general for the Empire, turns their back on the ways of the Empire. 
            Cyan, who wants revenge on the Empire for killing his family. Seitzer, the gambling pilot, a neutal party member turned ally and friend. Gau, a young orphaned child, set out to find his father.
            Strago, one of the few people in this world that can use magic, offers a lot of knowledge and lore about magic. Relm, a surrogate granddaughter to Strago with a good heart, also uses her magic to fight against the Empire.
            Shadow, a mystery assassin, helps the party here and there throughout the story. Mog, a playable Moogle. Umaro, a playable abominable snow-monster. And Gogo, a secret character that has the ability to mimic anyone. 
        </p2>
        <h4>My Thoughts on the Story</h4>
        <p2>
            At first, I didn't think the story was too different from the previous games. The characters each go through a lot and the stakes are high, however, I didn't really think the story was too different. 
            We find out that Terra is actually the last living Esper but also a hybrid human. From there, I found the story to be a lot more interesting. Instead of the same "Fight against the Empire" in previous games, there's more to the story. 
            And once we got to the big twist of the game, that's when I was super hooked. It wasn't until I started looking back to previous events from the big twist that I started to appreciate the game a lot more. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            One big thing that I thought was a negative was that there were too many characters. And because of that, the story doesn't develop some of the more lesser known playable characters. 
            You have the big important ones that carry the story like Terra, Locke, Celes, Sabin, Edgar, and even Cyan. But then there are some that weren't as developed like Gau, Seitzer, Strago, Relm, Shadow, Mog, Umaro, and Gogo that don't get much in the story. 
            In my opinion, some characters could be taken out and the story wouldn't have changed. Some of these characters are optional and secret, but I still think the party can be a little too big. 
        </p2>
        <h4>The Opera Scene</h4>
        <p2>
            The opera scene is what is famously talked about with this game. It foreshadows a lot of events of what is to come in the end, especially with the character of Celes. The storytelling was brilliantly told through the lense of a musical. 
            The lyrics that Celes was singing hold significant value to her character. Through first playthrough, it is poetic and sombering, but upon finishing the game and looking back, it is impactful.
        </p2>
        <h4>The Big Twist: SPOILERS AND TRIGGER WARNING</h4>
        <p2>
            Another thing about this game that makes it an incredible story is that the villain wins. Kefka, the villainous clown, takes over the Empire, kills the Emperor of the Empire, and destroys the world. The heroes don't win. 
            They failed their mission. The world is in ruin. The heroes are scattered throughout the land, missing, some pressumed dead. From here on out, you play as Celes. Who is at the end of her rope. 
            She's been taking care of her father figure, Cid. But he passes away due to sickness. Celes lost everything, her friends, her father figure, and her love (throughout the game, she develops feelings for Locke). 
            Seeing as she has lost her will to live, she makes an attempt on her life. Each character goes through this. Terra, the last magic wielder and the last of the Espers, loses her mwill to fight for what she believes in. 
            Locke's guilt over not protecting the love of his life. Each character deals with loss, but it is not until you keep moving and find your friends that you find the will to fight against Kefka again. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            When I initially played this game, I was in disbelief. The game kept going even after this event. I felt for these characters. 
            Although I did say earlier that the story didn't feel too different from previous games, I was still invested in the characters so I felt their loss when Kefka finally destroyed the world. 
            At this point, I retracted my words saying this game was like previous games. It really was a rare instance where I thought that the villain straight up just won and each character has to deal with it in a different way. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Themes</h4>
        <p2>
            The story deals with the theme of loss. Even before the big twist, every character has lost something or someone important in their lives. And the situation doesn't get any better after the big twist. 
            The story's big theme is to keep moving forward, never give up, and hope. No matter how things may look, always hold on to hope, and keep fighting for what you believe in or fight for what you love. 
            The themes are what make Final Fantasy VI very powerful and impactful.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <p2>
            In terms of gameplay, not a lot of things changed. The only thing that changed was the Esper system. I enjoyed the Esper system a lot. Once you master your Esper, you get their magic abilities. 
            The Espers can be summoned as well, dealing damage to the enemy as well as giving you or your enemy status effects. One Esper can regenerate your party's health upon summoned, which was very useful, especially when you are fighting bosses. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            The game also gives each character diversity. Blitz only works with Sabin. Him being a monk, you can input a string of buttons like you're playing a fighting game to execute some moves. He can do a Kamehameha if you input the button strings correctly. 
            Cyan has a technique called Bushido. Depending on how long he charges, he can unleash a powerful attack. Terra has a trance state where she transforms to an Esper, increasing her strength and magic while also halving the cost of her magic. 
        </p2>
        <br><br>
        <p2>
            The battle system can be exploited. If you grind enough, magic becomes so much stronger to the point where you don't want to attack with your weapons because they are too weak. Magic can be very overpowering in this game. 
            The gameplay as a whole is more or less the same as previous games with characters being an assigned job. This game, to me, is not necessarily focused on its gameplay as it is focused on story. 
        </p2>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2>
        <p2>
            The music is phenomenal here. Each track carries emotional weight to many scenes. Like the powerful, sombering opera scene, or the uncertainty of Terra's theme. 
            Even in the title music, it begins with the game having a loud minor key which makes the game a bit scary. Scenes and dialogue are carried with the music that feeds the emotion of each character. 
            The music help tell the story. Nobou Uematsu gave us a lot of incredible tracks: The Decisive Battle being my favorite. The music is truly a work of art.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VI is regarded as one of the best Final Fantay games by so many fans. The story is intense, tight, and incredible. The gameplay is more or less the same, but there is still new abilities that make it more interesting. 
            The music is the one of the most notible soundtracks in the series, conveying a lot of story, emotion, and intensity. Final Fantasy VI really is the pinnacle of JRPGs, or even RPGs in general. 
            If you are a getting into Final Fantasy, JRPGs, or RPGs for the first time, this is a highly recommended one.
