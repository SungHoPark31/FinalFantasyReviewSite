        <h1>Final Fantasy V</h1>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            In previous Final Fantasy games, you are tasked with finding the elemental crystals to either bring the light back to them or to gain their power. In Final Fantasy V, you don't do that. 
            The crystals are overused to power up towns or be used for everyday purposes. Because of their overuse, they explode. You do not save the crystals. Their shards is what gives you their power. 
            The story touches on the theme of Nature vs. Nurture, as well as Environmentalism. The main villain, Exdeath wants to punish humans for overusing the crystals.
            We follow a commoner named Bartz. Joining the party is the Princess of the Kingdom, Lenna, an old man with amnesia, Galuf, and a Pirate Captain, Faris.

            In terms of characters, I think Faris is the best character in my opinion. It is revealed early on that Faris is a woman. Commanding captain of the pirates. She has a hard exterior but has a soft side to her as well.
            Turns out, she is a long lost daughter of the King, making her sisters with Princess Lenna. Galuf also strikes me as an interesting character because he is not of this world. 
            He, along with three others (including Bartz's father), sealed the villain Exdeath long ago. Now that Exdeath has been released, Galuf must seal him again. Princess Lenna finds out that her father, the King, is missing and sets out to find him.
            Bartz is an everyday man but becomes important in the end because his father is not from this world and helped seal Exdeath.

            Unfortunately, this is the one Final Fantasy story that I have trouble remembering. There weren't as much memorable moments, areas, or boss battles in this game that I can recall. 
            The only boss battles that I recall are the main ones, Gilgamesh and Exdeath, and some other ones that require some strategy.
            It was also the funniest Final Fantasy game. There were a lot of comedic moments that did make me chuckle and have fun playing. 
            The story did something different, however, I do think that it was a step down from Final Fantasy IV. It wasn't a bad story, but I remember thinking that the story was decent when I initially finished the game.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <h4>The Job System</h4>
        <p2>
            Although the story is a step down from Final Fantasy IV, I do think this game makes up a lot with it's gameplay. The core gameplay is still the same from previous games, but the job system makes a return. And a lot more was added to it. 
            The job system here offers the same as Final Fantasy III's job system but added passive abilities. As you level up your job, you gain abilities. You can use these abilities for different assigned jobs, giving the game even more customization. 
            Final Fantasy V encourages replayability because of the very diverse job system. In Final Fantasy III, there were enemies that require you to equip a specific job. Final Fantasy V doesn't do that. Any enemy can be defeated by any job, which is very nice. 
            The gameplay is a lot more fun because of the improved job system.

            The only thing that I find problems with is the grind. Grinding is always encouraged in JRPGs, but I do not like it. As you fight battles, enemies drop Ability Points (AP), which levels up your job. 
            Depending on certain enemies, you gain 1-5 AP for fodder enemies after you defeat them. Some difficult enemies offer 10-20 AP. Bosses give you 0 AP from what I can remember. 
            When leveling up your job, they require more AP as you start mastering them. The most obscene one that I found were the mages. The Red Mage requires 999AP to master it. To me, that was just too much grinding. 
            Because of the job system having a very diverse and the quantity of jobs increased, it makes it a very grindy game.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy V's music is very good. There are a lot of memorable tracks like the main theme of Final Fantasy V, Four Hearts, the Prelude, the main Final Fantasy melody, the Overworld Theme, the Battle at the Big Bridge, and Dear Friends. 
            However, I did think that Final Fantasy IV had more memorable tracks in my opinion. Apparently, Nobou Uematsu originally thought that the game needed about 100 music tracks, but managed to reduce it to around 50.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            At the end of the day, Final Fantasy V is a very fun game that had a very successful job system and a great set of interesting characters. I just wished that I remembered more about the story. 
            I do remember the story being decent but not as good as Final Fantasy IV. That statement can change once I replay Final Fantasy V again. 
            This game is definitely one of the most replayable entry because of its customization, and I highly recommend playing through it or replaying it.
