        <h1>Final Fantasy III</h1>
        <hr>
        <p2>
            Fun Fact: Final Fantasy's release in the West Coast was super confusing. In Japan, they released each Final Fantasy with their respective numbers.
            However in the U.S., the numbers were different. The U.S. release of Final Fantasy I was Japan's Final Fantasy I.
            The U.S. release of Final Fantasy II was Japan's Final Fantasy IV. The U.S. release of Final Fantasy III was Japan's Final Fantasy VI.
            We never got a proper Final Fantasy III until it was remade and released on the Nintendo DS. 
        </p2>
        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy III starts off with four young characters accidentally stumbling in a cave. 
            They try to make their way out but come across a Wind Crystal. 
            The Crystal grants the children powers, instructing them to go forth and save the world.
            They venture out to find and restore the other elemental Crystals and defeat Xande, who seeks immortality. 
            The story is really simple, similar to both Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, there still isn't much story other than the theme of "Fulfilling your Destiny".

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <p2>
            Although there still isn't a lot of story yet, the game makes up for with gameplay. I would describe this game as a legacy game to the series. 
            There are so many gameplay elements that are still used to this day with later Final Fantasies. Random battles and level design was significantly better than FFII.
            Instead of five to ten steps for an encounter, it's more random, ranging from seven to fifteen steps. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Legacy</h4>
        <p2>
            This game introduced a lot of gameplay elements that are present in future games. I mentioned the job system before. This system was so successful that it made frequent returns to the series. 
            One of which was Final Fantasy V (we will discuss this more when we get to FFV). Another was the MMO RPG Final Fantasy XIV. Final Fantasy III also introduced summons. 
            It was the first appearance of many famous summons in the series: Ifrit, Shiva, Titan, Bahamut, etc. 
        </p2>
        <h4>Job System</h4>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy III introduces the job system. When the Crystal gave the four children powers, players can choose a job for each character. 
            In Final Fantasy I, you are limited to Knight, White Mage, Black Mage, and Thief. In Final Fantasy III, you start out with the same starter jobs.
            But the more you restore the Crystals, the more jobs you obtain. This game introduced more jobs like Summoner, Red Mage, Mystic Knight, Dragoon, etc.
            Each of these jobs have different looks to them and they have different abilities you can use in battle. The best part is, you can interchange jobs for each character any time you want.
            The job system made the game a lot of fun and a lot of customization. Characters can master their jobs and can offer powerful abilities. 
            This encourages replayability and a lot of customization with each playthrough. 
        </p2>
        <h4>The Not So Great</h4>
        <p2>
            The Job system was a very great addition to the series. It offered a lot to the series moving forward.
            However, there are things hold it back. Being that it is the first time it was introduced in the series, there are limitations. 
            Certain enemies require you to use certain job to defeat enemies, forcing you to level up those jobs. One enemy requires you to use the Dragoons Jump to evade their devestating attack. 
            There is another enemy that multiplys every time it gets hit. The Mystic Knight's weapons is the only thing that negate them from multiplying.

            A large staple of gameplay is using magic. This was also present in previous games. Magic is used to inflict damage to your foes, however, it drains Magic Points (MP). 
            To restore MP, you need an item called ether that is present in all the games... except this one. Final Fantasy III does not provide you with much when it comes to restoring MP. One way is elixirs, but they are hard to find and you cannot buy them at shops.
            The other is if you go to a save point. This means you are forced to use your magic sparingly and stategically, but what makes it kind of dumb is that you have to use magic throughout the game to progress. 
            There is one other Final Fantasy game that I can think of that doesn't allow you to use ether or items, but the difference between that and FFIII, is that FFIII doesn't allow these items in the base difficulty.

            The overworld is extremely large. Halfway through the game, you realize you are on a large floating chuck of land, which is only a section of a larger map. 
            You get around three airships. One that can travel on ground, on air and water, and overhead called The Invincible. Traversing through terrains can be inconvenient because of the many airships you acquire.
            I just wished that it was only one airship because whether you are at the endgame, grinding for EXP, or doing some sidequests, you have to switch to another airship to traverse through a certain terrain. 
            It gets annoying switching through ships.

            Final Fantasy also is notorious for having difficult final dungeons. In my opinion, this gane had the worst final dungeon. There are multiple floors/rooms. If I had to guess, there are around thirty of them.
            There are no save points, other than the one in the very end. On top of that, there are around seven boss battles for different sections of the final dungeon. And since there are no save points until the end, if you die, you start all the way back at the beginning.
            Leveling up is highly recommended for this part. It is very long and it is not so great to go through.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2>
        <p2>
            As always, the music is always very good in Final Fantasy. The prelude theme still plays in the title screen, and the Final Fantasy theme makes a return for this game. 
            For some reason, it wasn't present in Final Fantasy II, which I thought was odd. The overworld theme is the most memorable track in the soundtrack.
            But again, compared to the other Final Fantasies, it still isn't as memorable as the more later entries in the series.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            Despite the game trying out new and different things, I think it turned out to be a success because it set the baseline for every Final Fantasy after it and gave it its identity.
            Although there are flaws in the game, I still do think that this was a decent game. I would also say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
            Probably only to those who are huge JRPG fans, or want to know Final Fantasy's history.
