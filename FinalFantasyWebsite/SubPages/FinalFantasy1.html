        <h1>Final Fantasy (1987)</h1>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Its History</h2>
        <p2>Development history for this game is a story to be described as a miracle.
            SquareSoft (Referred now as SquareEnix before the rebrand) was going through bankruptcy.
            As a last ditch effort, they decided to give it their all and gamble with their final game with the limited technology that they had. Hence the name: Final Fantasy.
            The game was very well recieved, so much so that it saved the company from going out of business. This led to multiple sequels, spinoffs, movies, and many other media.
            It really makes you wonder, what it would've been like if SquareSoft did go through bankruptcy. I believe that many things would've changed in the video game industry. 
            Important games wouldn't have influenced the video game industry the same way as it did today or wouldn't have been released.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            In terms of story, there isn't a lot to cover. 
            There are four warriors of light, and they have to go through a series of fetch quests, fight the four fiends, restore the four elemental crystals, and save the world from chaos.
            Games back then didn't really have story to them. They had plots and fetch quests, however there was no character drama/dynamics, character arcs, tension, suspense, romance, or things that make for an engaging story.
            The game relied a lot on its gameplay.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Gameplay</h2>
        <p2>
            A lot of the gameplay fundementals of a Japanese Role Playing Game (JRPG) and a Final Fantasy game were planted here. For the first time, you could see your character sprites in battle.
            Before this entry, games such as Dragon Quest would only view the battle in first person. In this game, you can see your character in a field when they go to battle. 
            A lot of the typical JRPG gameplay is present here: Random battles, grinding to get to a higher level, world maps, airships, etc. I thought the magic system was interesting to say the least.
            Final Fantasy (1987) wasn't my first Final Fantasy so it was jarring to see the magic system. Essentially, there are different levels of magic that each character can do.
            On level 1, there's fire, thunder, and cure, and they all use up 1 Magic Points (MP). On the other hand, there's level 8 with flare, stop, and doom to name a few.
            These take up a significant amount of MP because of their level. I thought the gameplay was fun for what it was, but can be repetitive at times.
            The random encounters didn't bother me as much because they weren't as frequent as some of the other games.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Music</h2> 
        <p2>
            I thought the music was great. From the legendary Nobuo Uematsu, his composure for some of the tracks are very good here. It isn't as memorable as some of his later works, but it is still very good.
            The prelude crystal theme plays at the title screen and will be a presence in future games. The memorable Final Fantasy theme plays at the opening and the end of the game. 
            It gives me goosebumps everytime it's present in the later games.

            Fun Fact: The game was nearing launch, but there were talks about wanting a little bit more music to add more to the game. 
            They were on a time crunch, but Nobou Uematsu managed to create the prelude crystal theme in about ten minutes. 
            The prelude is just a scale going up and down a B flat major. I just thought it was genius.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            In conclusion, I think this game was a super solid entry. It is the first game in the series so I'm not too critical on it. Would I recommend it? 
            I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, however, if you are a fan of the JRPG genre or if you really want to, I would recommend it just to see what started it all. 
            There is a Pixel Remaster of the first six games, and if that is interesting, I think it is worth checking out.
