        <h1>Final Fantasy VIII</h1>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy VIII had the impossible task of following up with Final Fantasy VII. VII blew up and became a system seller for the PlayStation, making it the most popular game at that time. 
            Despite the task being impossible, SquareSoft accepted this challenge and moved forward into making it. In the eyes of the fanbase, it is definitely the most divisive one in the series. 
            Some consider it to be the "black sheep" of the group. I also have my fair share of good things to say about the game and my fair share of bad things about the game. Here is Final Fantasy VIII.

        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            I'm not entirely sure how to explain the story. It begins with a cutscene with the main protagonist Squall and his fight with Setzer, his rival. There are flashes of future events in the game as well as a woman in blue. 
            Squall and Setzer's battle gets even more heated and they both give each other a scar. After that, Squall heads back to school where he is training to be a SeeD member, mercenaries that graduated from Balamb Garden. 
            You meet Quistis and a lot more friends along the way. One of which is Rinoa. A compassionate, kind, caring, naive, stubborn, and impulsive person that Squall eventually falls in love with. 
            And together you have to journey to stop the Sorceress Edea from reaching another woman, Ellone, and using her to control time. The story deals with the theme of Time, Memories, Responsibility and Love.

            In my opinion, I think this game is decent enough but has way too many flaws in it. Some concepts and themes that the story wants to tell are either rushed or don't feel as impactful.
