        <h1>Final Fantasy IV</h1>

        <h2>My Thoughts on Story</h2>
        <p2>
            As a series first, Final Fantasy implemented storytelling. This included engaging themes, dialogue, character drama and relationships. 
            This paved the way and set the standard for storytelling for future Final Fantasy games. 
            This entry of the series is a very story driven game and the story itself is pretty decent, however, there are a fair share of problems with the story.

            The story tackles the themes of friendship, love, and redemption. Our main protagonist is Cecil, a dark knight of the Empire, who questions his decision to raid and steal a crystal from a village of Black mages. 
            His story us about his turn from the Empire, redeeming himself and becoming the Paladin of Light. Along with his journey, he is accompanied by 
            Kain (his Dragoon best friend), Rosa (the Healer and his lover), Edward (the Bard), Rydia (the Summoner), Yang (the Monk), Tella (the Sage), Palom and Porom (The Black Mage and the White Mage), Cid (The Engineer), and Edge (the Ninja/Thief).
            Their goal is to defeat Golbez, the all powerful villain of the story, who wants to collect the Crystals and take over the world.

        <h4>The Problems with the Story: SPOILERS</h4>
        <p2>
            The main problem I have with the story is that it is a mess, for instance the plot. There are characters that will die in this story, but in actuallity, they are not. At the end of the game, all the characters that supposedly "died", all come back, alive, to help the party. 
            This happens for four different characters in the game. It gets to a point where my suspension of disbelief decreases as the story unfolds because I feel like there are no stakes. The story is also a lot like Star Wars. 
            Plotpoints and areas in the game gave me the similar feel and mood to Star Wars. Golbez has a very similar design and goal with Darth Vader. There was also an area that resembled the Death Star. Cecil resembles Luke Skywalker, Rosa resembles Princess Leia, etc.

            Final Fantasy also has a weird story point that is present in some of the games. It's where the villain isn't really a villain. They were either mind-controlled, they were actually the servants of the big bad, or it's a big twist saying that there is an even bigger villain.
            In this one, as a player, we are lead to believe that the villain is Golbez the entire time, but he was mind-controlled by an even bigger villain named Zemus. The problem with this kind of storytelling is that Zemus was never hinted or mentioned in the story until the very very end.
            This makes the story feel disorienting because of its inconsistancy.

            In previous games, there are usually four elemental crystals: Wind, Earth, Fire, and Water. For whatever reason, there are sixteen crystals. Eight crystals of light in the overworld, and eight dark crystals in the underworld. 
            Personally, I feel like there are too many crystals, which makes the game feel like a mess. The plot revolves around these crystals, which make it into a large fetch quest on macguffins.

        <h4>The Good Things with the Story</h4>
        <p2>
            Although there are problems with the story, there are a lot of good things to take away from it. The first is the characters. Each characters is written really well and they go through interesting arcs. The character interactions made the story a lot more engaging. 
            The dialogue between everyone made the story much more believable and made the characters feel like actual people. In previous games, as I mentioned, characters didn't talk to each other. They would just tell the player what to do and why you need to do it and that's it. 
            Character drama gave the story a lot more tension. Kain betrays the party a couple of times, and characters would actually react accordingly. They story may not be great in certain parts, but at least the characters were written well.

            I played the DS version that was ported on Steam. The great addition to this version of the game is voice acting. Voice acting gave this game a lot more life. 
            Instead of having text bubbles, the voice acting does that for you while conveying the emotion that the characters feel. It was a great addition to the game.

        <h2>My Thoughts on the Gameplay</h2>
        <p2>
            For Final Fantasy IV, I played the DS version that was ported on Steam. This version is the most difficult version of the game. Enemies hit a lot harder, and the random battles are less random. The quantity of enemies increased and there are a lot less save points, making the game more difficult.
            In my opinion, I think that this game was runner up for the worst random battles in the series. Final Fantasy II also had the worst random battles, however, the difference is that Final Fantasy IV's level design is much better than Final Fantasy II's.
            The boss battles were annoying but honestly some of them were pretty fun. Which means you have to strategize your battles and pick which character will attack which. My favorite boss was the one where you fight the four fiends: Scarmiglione, Cagnazzo, Barbariccia, Rubicante.
        </p2>
        <h4>Active Time Battle</h4>
        <p2>
            The gameplay is a lot more fun because of the introduction of the Active Time Battle system. This system was very successful, to the point where it is present in all the future games after it. 
            Instead of the "wait your turn" kind of gameplay, there is a meter that determines when your character attacks. This offers a lot more stakes and encourages strategy. Some spells, attacks, and abilities require a more load time than the rest. 
            I thought this system made the game a lot more fun, once you get how the ATB system works, it can make you feel like a high level strategist especially in boss battles.

        <h2>My Thoughts on the Music</h2>
        <p2>
            The music is phenomenal in this game. The normal crystal prelude plays in the menu but for the first time, Nobou Uematsu added a melody to the scale, making the song more longer and more amazing. 
            This is present in future games. I thought a lot of the music in this game were very memorable. The main theme plays in the overworld, the battle theme, the boss themes, the theme of love playing when Cecil and Rosa are around, the Kingdom of Baron, 
            Troia'a theme playing at Troia, and the Tower of Babil theme were the most memorable to me.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p2>
            Final Fantasy IV introduced many many concepts in the series that are used in future games. I think this game set the standard for what the quality of this series will be like moving forward: storytelling, ATB gameplay, characters, dialogue, and music conveying emotions. 
            Although, the flaws with the execution of these concepts, such as the plot of the story, I still would recommend it. Whether it being good, or bad, if someone were to start a Final Fantasy for the first time, I would always recommend this one.
